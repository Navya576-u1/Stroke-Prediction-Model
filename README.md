# 🧠 Stroke Prediction Model

This project predicts the likelihood of a person having a stroke based on health and demographic data using Machine Learning.

## 📊 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict whether a patient is likely to suffer a stroke.
- **Dataset:** Healthcare Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Tools Used:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## ⚙️ Model Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Encoding & Scaling
4. SMOTE
5. Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
6. Hyperparameter Tunning
7. Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall)

## 📁 Files in this Repository
- `HEARTSTROKE.ipynb` → Full Jupyter Notebook  
- `healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv` → Dataset  
- `.pkl` files → Encoders and trained model objects  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Navya576-u1/Stroke-Prediction-Model.git
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file HEARTSTROKE.ipynb
3. Run all cells to reproduce the model and results

## 📈 Results

Best Model: Random Forest Classifier
Accuracy: ~90%
Key Insight: Age and BMI are strong predictors of stroke risk.
